## Summary

This calculator app was made when I was a student on the Northcoders Bootcamp, and had just started learning how to use React. The file structure could easily be improved with time, for example, by separating out each button into its own component, and I have the intention of amending this with time.
Going forward, there is an option to add further functionality to make it closer to a "scientific calculator".
